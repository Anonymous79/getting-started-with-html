    <h1>Conroy's Notes</h1>
<b> Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML </b>

<h2>Part 1   Overview of the Internet</h2>
<b>1.1	Internet</b>
<p> The <em> internet </em> is a bunch of computers communicating over <em> HTTP </em>.
</P>

<b>1.2 	Web Page </b>
<p> A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
</p>
<p> The web was <em>invented</em> in the 1990s and has something of a billion web pages!
</p>

<b>1.3	 The Basics of How the World Wide Web Works</b>
<p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a <b> <em> HTTP </em> </b> <em> Request </em> via the internet to a <b> <em> server </em> </b>. The server finds
  the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a <b><em>web browser</em></b> such as (internet explorer, chrome, Firefox, Etc.) interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.
</p>
<p>It is also a collection of html documents; these documents are made of html (<b>HyperText Markup Language</b>). This is the basis for almost every webpage even though there can be <em> docs, images, videos, music</em>; anything can exist on the web, but
  html is what glues everything together and the link between these pages called hyperlinks is what makes the web, web-like!
</p>
<p>The servers are computers <b><em>optimised</em></b> for sitting in a closet and hosting files rather than browsing. The HTTP is a simple protocol that a browser uses to communicate with servers.

</p>

<b>1.4 Summarizing Major Components of the Web</b>
<p>
  • <b>Web Browsers</b>: A program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web
  <br> • <b>HTTP</b>: the main protocol of the web
  <br> • <b>Servers</b>: computers that host the files that make up the web
  <br> • <b>The Internet</b>: the world’s largest computer network
  <br> • <b>URLs</b>: how you refer to document on the web
  <br> • <b>Web Applications</b>
</p>

<b> 1.5	  How Coding Works</b>
<p> Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. For example, the computer might do this by making text like this:
</p>
<p> I'm learning to code!
</p>
<p> look like this:
</P>
<p> I'm <b>learning</b> to code!
</P>

  <h2>Part 2 Introduction to HTML Tags to Create HTML Documents</h2>
  <b> 2.1 HTML</b>
  <p> HTML stands for <em> Hypertext Markup Language</em>. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see" and <em> markup</em> which describes "how it looks".
    <a href="www.dontbothertoclick" target="_blank"> This video</a> gives a good overview.
  </p>

  <b> 2.2 Tags and Elements </b>
  <p> HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b> even though these tags aren't visible to users of a web page, they still carry meaning that is meaningful to web
    browsers.
    <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">This video</a> explains the distinctions well.
  </p>

  <p> <b>• Tag </b>: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (
    < p> for example) and a closing tag, (
      < / p>). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the
        < br> tag). Tags are of the general notation
          < Name> Contents
            < /Name>. Some exmaples and uses of tags are as follows:
              < b> tag for bold size,
                < em> tag for italices size, anchor tag
                  < a> for making links, image tag
                    < mg> for images , break tag
                      < br> for whitespace, paragraph tag
                        < p> , Etc.
  </p>
  <p> <b>• Element</b>: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags. HTML documents are made up of HTML 'elements'.
  </p>
  <p> <b>• Attribute</b>: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Reddit URL, you would write
    < a href="www.reddit.com"> </a>
  </p>

  <b>2.3 Inline vs Block Elements</b>
  <p> HTML elements are either <b> inline </b> e.g.
    < br> ,
      < b>,
        < em>,
          < img> or <b> block </b> like the
            < p>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
  </p>

  <b>2.4   Why Computers are Stupid</b>
  <p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.
  </p>
  <p> Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").
  </P>
  <p>For example, if you forget to close a
    < b> tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold. This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it to do anything you
      want.
  </p>
  <b> 2.5	  Programmers Can't Remember Everything </b>
  <p> There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just <b> look it up </b>!
